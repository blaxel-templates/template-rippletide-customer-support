Rippletide × Blaxel Integration Guide
Build reliable, production-ready AI agents using Rippletide's SDK and Blaxel's platform.

Overview
Rippletide provides an SDK to build reliable and governed agents. Blaxel provides a secure sandbox platform that lets you host agents next to them for near instant performances.

The Rippletide × Blaxel integration lets you:
- Create an agent using Rippletide SDK
- Configure your agent with Q&A pairs, tool calls, guardrails, and user inputs
- Evaluate your agent by extracting questions from a PDF and testing responses
- Deploy the agent to Blaxel with one command
- Access a hosted inference endpoint for your applications
- Build real customer-support or workflow agents with near-zero hallucinations

1. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Rippletide API key (get it from https://eval.rippletide.com)
- A Blaxel account
- Python 3.10+
- uv package manager (recommended)
- Git installed

Optional:
- Basic JSON knowledge
- Understanding of REST APIs

2. Clone the Integration Template
The official template is available here:
https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-rippletide-customer-support

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-rippletide-customer-support 
cd template-rippletide-customer-support

Install dependencies:
uv sync

This installs all required libraries for Rippletide + Blaxel.

3. Configure Your API Key
Get your Rippletide API key:
1. Go to https://eval.rippletide.com
2. Login and go to settings
3. Generate your API key

Update the hardcoded API key in these files:
- src/setup_agent.py - Update RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY = ""
- src/agent.py - Update RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

4. Understanding Agent Configuration
Your agent's logic lives inside the agent_config.json file:
- agent_purpose: The main prompt describing your agent's role
- qa_pairs: Pairs of questions and ground-truth answers
- guardrails: Rules and constraints you want to apply to your agent
- tool_calls: External API calls your agent can make
- user_input_collection: Information your agent needs to collect from users
- format_answer: Instructions for formatting responses
- state_predicate: Rules for when the agent should end conversations

👉 To customize your agent, simply edit agent_config.json.

5. Create and Evaluate Your Rippletide Agent
Copy the example configuration:
cp agent_config.json.example agent_config.json

Edit agent_config.json with your configuration (optional).

Run the setup script with a PDF containing questions:
uv run src/setup_agent.py agent_config.json --pdf knowledge.pdf

This script performs the following:
- Loads your agent configuration
- Creates a brand-new SDK agent in your Rippletide workspace
- Configures Q&A pairs, tool calls, guardrails, and user inputs
- Creates an evaluation agent
- Extracts questions and expected answers from the PDF
- Asks the SDK agent the first question from the PDF
- Gets the agent's answer
- Evaluates the answer against the expected answer from the PDF
- Prints the evaluation report
- Returns an Agent ID

6. Blaxel Platform Setup
Complete Blaxel setup by following the quickstart guide:
https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart

Install Blaxel CLI:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh

Login to Blaxel:
bl login

7. Deploy the Agent on Blaxel
Blaxel handles hosting and runtime execution for your Rippletide agent.

a. Test locally
Run the local development sandbox:
bl serve --hotreload

This launches a local environment exposing your agent's inference endpoint.

Test the agent:
bl chat --local template-rippletide-customer-support

b. Deploy to production
bl deploy

Blaxel will build and deploy your project, then generate a public inference endpoint, for example:
https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}

This URL is now your production-ready agent endpoint.

You can call it from:
- Customer support tools
- Websites
- Back-office apps
- CRMs
- Slack/Teams bots
- Internal systems

8. Calling Your Agent
Send a POST request to your Blaxel endpoint:
curl -X POST https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/agents/YOUR-AGENT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hi, I need help with my recent order.",
    "user_id": "customer_123"
  }'

The request is processed as follows:
- Input → forwarded to your LLM
- LLM generates hypotheses
- Hypotheses → validated, corrected, and authorized by Rippletide
- Rippletide selects the only safe, allowed action
- Action is executed by your runtime
- Response is returned to the caller

9. Evaluating Your Agent
The evaluation is integrated into the setup script. When you run:
uv run src/setup_agent.py agent_config.json --pdf knowledge.pdf

The script automatically:
- Creates an SDK agent using your configuration
- Creates an evaluation agent
- Extracts questions and expected answers from the PDF
- Asks the first question to the SDK agent
- Evaluates the answer against the expected answer
- Prints the evaluation report

The PDF parameter is required - it provides the questions and expected answers for evaluation.

10. Extending Your Agent
You can easily extend the template to build:
- Multi-step workflows
- Eligibility decisions
- Refund processes
- Technical troubleshooting trees
- Multi-language support
- Form-filling logic
- Routing (tier 1 → tier 2)
- Escalation rules
- State-aware conversations

Simply update:
- agent_config.json for knowledge, tool calls, guardrails, and user inputs
- Rippletide handles consistency, safety, and decision correctness automatically.

10. Troubleshooting
The agent fails to create
- Check your API key in src/setup_agent.py
- Ensure RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY is set correctly
- Make sure you have a PDF file with questions for evaluation

Blaxel deploy fails
Run:
bl auth login

The agent behavior is incorrect
Re-run the setup after modifying agent_config.json:
uv run src/setup_agent.py agent_config.json --pdf knowledge.pdf

No questions extracted from PDF
- Ensure your PDF contains extractable Q&A pairs
- Check that the PDF file path is correct
- The script will try to get test prompts from the evaluation agent if PDF extraction returns no results

Endpoint returns an error
Try bl serve locally first to debug.

11. Summary
With this integration, you can:
- Build a safe, deterministic AI agent using Rippletide
- Structure logic using a simple JSON configuration file
- Deploy instantly using Blaxel
- Access a production-ready inference endpoint in minutes

The integration template provides everything you need to go from idea → reliable production agent with almost no boilerplate.

12. Q&A
What does the Rippletide × Blaxel integration enable?
The integration connects Rippletide's Decision Database with Blaxel's secure runtimes, giving you a fast way to build agents that are reliable and production-ready.
- Rippletide handles the logic, rules, and guardrails.
- Blaxel handles runtime, deployment, scaling, and hosting.

👉 Learn more about Rippletide's developer platform:
https://eval.rippletide.com/

👉 Explore the Blaxel platform:
https://app.blaxel.ai/

Is this integration difficult to use?
Not at all. The template is designed for developers who want to ship quickly.
You clone the repo, customize your agent_config.json, create your agent with PDF evaluation, and deploy.

Why should I pair Rippletide with Blaxel?
Because you get the best of both worlds:
- Rippletide → Agent safety, guardrails, state, rules, <1% hallucination rate
- Blaxel → Instant deployments, scaling, secured sandbox, YC-quality DX

What types of agents can I deploy with this integration?
Examples include:
- Customer support agents
- Internal helpdesk assistants
- Sales & qualification agents
- Ops/process copilots
- Troubleshooting and diagnostics agents
- Next-best-action decision flows

How does this improve reliability?
Rippletide externalizes decision-making out of the LLM.
The LLM only interprets intent — it doesn't decide what to do.
Rippletide validates, rewrites, and authorizes every action.

What do I need to customize?
Just edit agent_config.json:
- qa_pairs for knowledge
- tool_calls for external API integration
- guardrails for safety rules
- user_input_collection for collecting user information
- format_answer for response formatting

Rippletide compiles these into a structured decision layer.
Blaxel handles deployment.

Can I call the agent from my product?
Yes — once deployed, Blaxel gives you a standard HTTPS endpoint.
You can integrate it into:
- Web apps
- Mobile apps
- CRMs
- Ticketing systems
- Internal tools
- Slack / Teams bots

Is this ready for enterprise use?
Yes. Together, Rippletide and Blaxel provide:
- Deterministic decisions
- Auditability & traceability
- Policy enforcement
- Low-latency inference
- Secure sandbox execution
- Multi-environment support
